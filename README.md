# JavaScript Basics (Functions, Loops, If Statements, and Arrays) - Task Overview

This project delves into core JavaScript concepts, focusing on **functions**, **loops**, **if statements**, and **arrays**. It includes practical exercises to enhance understanding and improve problem-solving skills using JavaScript.

## Overview

The tasks include:

1. **Using functions** to encapsulate reusable blocks of code and improve modularity.
2. **Implementing loops** for repetitive actions, including:
   - Iterating over arrays.
3. **Using if statements** to evaluate conditions and execute code based on logical decisions.
4. **Working with arrays** to store, retrieve, and manipulate collections of data.
5. **Combining functions, loops, if statements, and arrays** to create dynamic and interactive JavaScript programs.

By completing these exercises, learners will strengthen their ability to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and arrays effectively in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for the tasks.
- **HTML**: To provide a basic structure for running JavaScript in a browser.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Functions
- Defining and calling functions.
- Using parameters and return values.

### 2. Loops
- Iterating with:
  - `for`
  - `while`
  - `do while`
- Nested loops for advanced operations.

### 3. If Statements
- Conditional execution using:
  - `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

### 4. Arrays
- Creating and accessing array elements.
- Iterating over arrays.
- Performing operations like addition, removal, and searching.
